# iOS Calculator App

## Project Overview
This project involves the development of a fully functional iOS calculator application. It replicates the core features and design of the native iOS calculator while incorporating layout adaptation for different screen sizes and orientations. The application was built using Swift and Xcode.

## Features
- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
- Advanced operations: handling negative numbers and decimal points.
- Robust error handling: supports input validation for division by zero, invalid expressions, etc.
- Adaptive layout: fully responsive to different screen sizes and orientations using Auto Layout.

## Development Process
1. **Planning and Layout Design**:
   - Designed the user interface in Storyboard, ensuring a responsive layout by utilizing `StackView` and proper constraints.
   - Incorporated Auto Layout for adapting to various device screens and orientations.

2. **Core Functionality Implementation**:
   - Linked UI elements with the codebase.
   - Wrote Swift functions to handle arithmetic logic, including complex scenarios like negative numbers and floating-point operations.
   - Tested and debugged to ensure robustness against invalid inputs.

3. **Enhanced User Experience**:
   - Implemented smooth transitions and logical user interactions.
   - Debugged and refined error handling mechanisms to prevent application crashes.

4. **Optimization**:
   - Optimized code for performance and readability.
   - Tested on multiple devices and screen orientations to ensure compatibility.

## Challenges
- Managing layout adaptability for various screen sizes and orientations.
- Differentiating between the subtraction operator and the negative sign within expressions.
- Debugging complex issues related to arithmetic operations and input parsing.

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Proficiency in using Swift for developing iOS applications.
- Experience with Xcode tools, including Storyboard and Auto Layout.
- Understanding of iOS application lifecycle and event handling.
- Improved problem-solving skills for debugging and handling edge cases.
